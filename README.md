# Deep Learning Image Classification

This repository contains two deep learning projects focused on image classification:

1. **Project 1: Image Classification - ANN vs. CNN Performance**
   - A comprehensive comparison of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification tasks.
   - The project explores the performance of both models using various datasets, with all epochs set to 100 by default and utilizing the Adam optimizer.

2. **Project 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN**
   - A deep learning model using CNN for recognizing handwritten digits, trained on the MNIST dataset.
   - The model is trained with 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer to achieve high accuracy in classifying digits.
